/**
 * The Abstract Factory design pattern, as described by the Gang of Four (GoF),
 * provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
 * without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to produce objects
 * that share a common theme, ensuring consistency across related components. The
 * pattern typically involves an abstract factory interface with multiple concrete
 * implementations, each responsible for creating variants of objects that adhere
 * to a specific theme or configuration. This promotes loose coupling, making it
 * easier to introduce new product families without modifying existing client code.
 * It is often used in UI toolkits, database connections, and cross-platform
 * development to manage different implementations seamlessly.
 * <p>
 * The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface
 * for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete
 * classes. It allows a client to create objects from multiple related product families
 * without knowing the exact class of the objects being created. This pattern typically
 * involves creating abstract product classes and concrete product families, with an abstract
 * factory class that defines methods for creating each product. The concrete factory
 * subclasses implement these methods to instantiate specific product families. This pattern
 * is useful when the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed,
 * and represented, ensuring that products from a specific family are used together.
