/**
 * The Adapter design pattern, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns,
 * is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by
 * providing a bridge between them. It acts as a wrapper that translates one interface
 * into another expected by the client, enabling objects with different interfaces to
 * communicate without modifying their existing code. This pattern is commonly used when
 * integrating legacy systems or third-party libraries with an applicationâ€™s existing
 * codebase. There are two main types of adapters: class adapters, which use inheritance,
 * and object adapters, which use composition.
 * <p>
 * The Adapter pattern, one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, is a structural pattern
 * that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge by creating an
 * intermediary object that converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client
 * expects. Essentially, it enables classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate without
 * modifying their existing code. This is particularly useful when integrating legacy systems or
 * third-party libraries into an application, as it helps to make disparate components work together
 * seamlessly by providing a consistent interface.
