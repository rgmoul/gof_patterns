/**
 * The Chain of Responsibility design pattern, part of the Gang of Four (GoF) behavioral
 * patterns, allows multiple handlers to process a request without the sender needing to
 * know which handler will handle it. The request is passed along a chain of handlers,
 * each deciding whether to process it or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This
 * pattern promotes loose coupling by decoupling request senders from receivers and enables
 * dynamic processing chains. It is useful in scenarios like event handling, middleware
 * pipelines, and logging frameworks, where multiple entities may have the opportunity to
 * handle a request in a structured and flexible manner.
