/**
 * The Command design pattern, part of the Gang of Four (GoF) behavioral patterns, encapsulates
 * a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing
 * requests, and logging their execution. It consists of a Command interface with an execute()
 * method, concrete command classes implementing specific actions, and an Invoker that triggers
 * commands without knowing their implementation details. This pattern promotes decoupling
 * between senders and receivers of requests, making it useful for implementing undo/redo
 * functionality, task scheduling, and macro commands in applications.
