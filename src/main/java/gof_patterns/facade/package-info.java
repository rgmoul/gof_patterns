/**
 * The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex
 * subsystem, making it easier to use and interact with. It involves creating a single class, known as
 * the “facade,” which aggregates and delegates calls to a set of interfaces or classes in the
 * subsystem, hiding their complexities from the client. By offering a higher-level interface, the
 * facade minimizes the client’s knowledge of the inner workings of the subsystem, improving usability
 * and reducing dependencies between the client and the subsystem components. This pattern is
 * particularly useful when working with large, complex systems where ease of use and separation of
 * concerns are important.
