/**
 * The Interpreter pattern, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) book, is a behavioral design pattern
 * used to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to process sentences in that
 * language. It is particularly useful when dealing with domain-specific languages (DSLs) or symbolic
 * processing, such as mathematical expressions, SQL parsing, or scripting engines. The pattern typically
 * involves defining an AbstractExpression interface and multiple ConcreteExpression classes that
 * represent different elements of the grammar. A Context object may be used to store global information
 * during interpretation. While flexible, the pattern is best suited for simple grammars, as it can become
 * complex and inefficient for large or intricate languages.
