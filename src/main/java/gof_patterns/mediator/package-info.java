/**
 * The Mediator Pattern from the “Gang of Four” (GoF) design patterns is a behavioral design pattern
 * that defines an object called a mediator to centralize communication between objects, thereby
 * reducing the direct dependencies between them. Instead of objects interacting with each other
 * directly, they communicate via the mediator, which handles the coordination and communication
 * logic. This decouples the objects, making the system easier to maintain and extend. The Mediator
 * pattern is especially useful in complex systems where multiple objects need to interact, as it
 * simplifies interactions by centralizing the control flow and reducing the number of inter-object
 * dependencies.
