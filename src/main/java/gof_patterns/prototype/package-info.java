/**
 * The Prototype pattern, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, is a creational pattern
 * that allows for the cloning of objects to create new instances rather than constructing them from
 * scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is a costly operation or when there
 * is a need to create multiple copies of an object with similar state. By defining a common interface for
 * cloning objects (often through a clone() method), the Prototype pattern enables the creation of new
 * instances by duplicating an existing prototype object, making it easier to manage and configure complex
 * object structures. It is commonly employed in scenarios where new objects are variations of an existing
 * instance and where the overhead of creating objects from scratch is prohibitive.
