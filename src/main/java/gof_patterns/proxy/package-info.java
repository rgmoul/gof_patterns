/**
 * The Proxy pattern, one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, provides a surrogate or placeholder
 * object that controls access to another object, typically to manage the performance, security, or
 * resource consumption of the original object. The Proxy acts as an intermediary, allowing the client to
 * interact with it instead of the real object. It can be used in different contexts, such as virtual
 * proxies, which delay the creation of resource-intensive objects until needed; remote proxies, which
 * represent objects in a different address space (e.g., across a network); and protection proxies, which
 * control access to sensitive or restricted objects based on certain conditions. The Proxy pattern helps
 * in decoupling object responsibilities and controlling access to resources.
