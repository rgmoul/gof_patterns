/**
 * The Singleton pattern, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) book, ensures that a class has only
 * one instance throughout the applicationâ€™s lifecycle and provides a global point of access to that
 * instance. This is achieved by making the constructor private and creating a static method that
 * manages the creation and access of the single instance. The pattern is useful when exactly one
 * object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in the case of managing shared
 * resources, configuration settings, or logging. Careful implementation is required to handle issues
 * like lazy initialization, thread safety, and potential difficulties with testing and extending the
 * class.
