/**
 * The State pattern, one of the Gang of Four (GoF) behavioral design patterns, allows an object to
 * change its behavior dynamically based on its internal state. Instead of using complex conditional
 * logic to handle different states, the pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior within separate
 * state classes and delegates state transitions to the object itself. This makes the code more
 * maintainable, scalable, and aligned with the Open/Closed Principle. The pattern is particularly
 * useful when an objectâ€™s behavior depends on its state, such as in finite state machines, workflow
 * engines, and UI components with different modes.
